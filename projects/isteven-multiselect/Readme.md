# Isteven Multiselect

This project basically gonna help using dropdown / select in efficient manner. This idea has been inspired by AngularJS [isteven-multiselect](http://isteven.github.io/angular-multi-select). In terms of UI it will look somewhat similar to isteven multiselect, but interms of code it may not exactly architectured in the same way.
Currently I'm planning to support the feature provided by isteven-multiselect, plus other features (list going to updated soon). Still this library is under alpha version.

## Plans

This plans are based on current idea, it could change in future. First thing I'd like to cover all the features that have been used in isteven branch. Each feature will make sure that it should done in optimistic way of 

 1. Single Select
 2. Multiple Select
 3. Dynamic Update datasource
 4. Enable / Disable
 5. Form Support with ControlValueAccessor
 6. Grouping 
 7. Helper Elements
 8. Output Events
 9. Callbacks
10. Observable Friendly
11. Lazy loading smooth support.
12. Templating Support for each type
13. Configuration Super Easy
14. NgIvy friendly
15. Angular Elements friendly
16. i18 support.
17. Server side rendering support
18. Optimal / Super fast rendering.
19. Theming Support
20. Core features will be shifted to core JS.

Estimates of each fetures will be added soon. Stay toon. 
I've not started the work 

**Note:** This repository is into early architecting phase, interested can ping me for contribution.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
