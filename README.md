# Isteven Multiselect

This project basically gonna help using dropdown / select in efficient manner. This idea has been inspired by AngularJS [isteven-multiselect](http://isteven.github.io/angular-multi-select). In terms of UI it will look somewhat similar to isteven multiselect, but interms of code it may not exactly architectured in the same way.
Currently I'm planning to support the feature provided by isteven-multiselect, plus other features (list going to updated soon). Still this library is under alpha version.

Using Angular 7 version right now.

## Plans

This plans are based on current idea, it could change in future. First thing I'd like to cover all the features that have been used in isteven branch. Each feature will make sure that it should done in optimistic way of 

 1. ~~Single Select~~
 2. ~~Multiple Select~~
 3. Dynamic Update datasource
 4. ~~Enable / Disable~~
 5. ~~Form Support with ControlValueAccessor~~ //TODO: Prepopulate value to form
 6. Grouping 
 7. ~~Helper Elements~~ (TODO: Reset)
 8. Output Events
 9. Callbacks
10. Observable Friendly
11. Lazy loading smooth support.
12. Templating Support for each type
13. Configuration Super Easy
14. NgIvy friendly
15. Angular Elements friendly
16. i18 support.
17. Server side rendering support
18. Optimal / Super fast rendering.
19. Theming Support
20. Core features will be shifted to core JS.

Estimates of each fetures will be added soon. Stay toon.

2. `ng serve`

To play around with this repository you have to run below two commands
1. `npm run isteven-watch` - This command will help to build isteven library everytime when you change any file from it.  
2. `ng serve` - To run application, it will consume live isteven library
